# 🔍Airbnb Data Analysis Project - SQL Skills
Project Purpose
To demonstrate a full SQL project from scractch - DO NOT WORRY IF you are not familiarized with SQL language, it is everything documented and you will be able to follow this data-story until the end and 🕵🏻🔍find amazing improvement opportunities for hosts🕵🏻🔍 to implement in case you are interested in Airbnb business -

The data consists of Airbnb listings, reviews, hosts information and more. Throughout data queries and exploration I deal with SELECT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, LIMIT, CASE, WHERE, INNER JOINS and more. I documented different queries to help you understand the dataset even if you are not familiarized with SQL language.

Libraries used: Pandas(Python) and SQLite3. (I chose to document SQL language in a Jupyter notebook because I wanted to show you all the intermediate steps taken to query the data and making sure the entire analysis is in a single notebook easy to review, present and reproduce).
