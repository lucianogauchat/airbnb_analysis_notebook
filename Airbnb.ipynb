We had to search around for the thermostat. There is conveniently a grocery store just across the street. We all felt like the place should have been cleaned better, especially since there is a cleaning fee that we paid. There were dirty dishes in the kitchen, the floors were a bit dirty (socks got dirty after walking around the apartment for an hour or so), and the place is obviously usually lived in, as closets, under the beds, behind the couch, etc. were all full of clothes and other household items and papers. It felt like we were staying at a stranger&#x27;s home while they were out of town. Overall, we would probably stay there again, as the price was reasonable and it was big enough for three of us, has a washer/dryer, very small kitchen, wifi, and good location, though to be honest we expected to find the place in a little better condition.</td>\n",

We checked in after 4pm, however, the property had not been clean from previous customers, the bed unmade, &amp; the kitchen/bathroom dirty. Tony arrived just after us, and apologised for the state of the place, making excuses for the cleaning staff, and offered us a bottle of red to make up for it. We accepted, &amp; patiently waited while Tony remade the bed &amp; quickly flung a mop over the bathroom. It was hardly an intensive clean, &amp; we had to clean glasses/mugs before using them, as they had a film of dust on them. We started to feel like this property wasn&#x27;t up to scratch, especially when paying $250 per night! Before Tony left, we noticed a glass window in the bedroom was taped up with scotch tape &amp; that aluminium foil was jammed between the door in the bedroom. We asked Tony about these, he said the foil was probably to stop the draft coming through, &amp; gave us some extra tape for the glass window in case we needed to retape the broken glass window. We were in shock to be honest that this property was even legally safe to be listed, also is was cold, windy, rainy weather, &amp; the place was not even airtight! After Tony left we started unpacking our clothes, when I noticed that the drawers were dirty, that was the last straw. We called Tony &amp; told him we weren&#x27;t happy, &amp; he seemed to understand (like it was a common problem) and offered us a reduction in price to $150/night. We honestly thought it wasn&#x27;t even worth $150 in that condition, &amp; explained that we&#x27;d take the offer of $150 for that first night, however, we&#x27;d be checking out first thing next morning. He understood, &amp; said we had his word that he would only charge us $150 for the nights accommodation. I enquired about how &amp; when he would intend on refunding our money, &amp; he asked me to send him my credit card details, as he would refund the same card, which I did text to him immediately (29/8/14). Four days later (2/9/14) he texts me asking for my bank account details to refund our money, I asked him why he wasn&#x27;t able to use the credit card given already &amp; he said he didn&#x27;t have the facilities to refund our credit card (bit dodgy, as he&#x27;d already asked for my CC details). Tony then refunded our account $517 on 3/9/14, leaving us to pay a total of $317 for 1 nights accommodation. He even tried to tell us his wine he gifted us was a $100 bottle, which we&#x27;ve since checked &amp; its only worth $18! So now we think, great, here&#x27;s this dodgy guy who&#x27;s provided us shoddy accommodation, lied to us &amp; now has our credit card details!! NOT HAPPY!</td>\n",

You also need it when the toilet doesn&#x27;t flush and the grate in the middle of the bathroom becomes  a volcano with torrents of water pouring out faster than you can clean it up.
